a. Increase Virtual Disk Size
Expand the disk in VMware:

Power off the VM.
Go to VMware settings for the VM.
Increase the size of the virtual hard disk.
Resize Partitions in the VM:

Once you've increased the disk size in VMware, you need to resize the partitions inside the VM.
Boot into the system, then check if the system detects the new disk size:

### pour afficher la taille du disk sudo du -ah / ¶ sort -rh ¶ head -n 20 
#sudo fdisk -l
Use GParted or growpart to resize the partition:

Install growpart and parted if you don't have them:

# sudo apt-get install cloud-guest-utils parted

Resize the partition (example for /dev/sda1):

# sudo growpart /dev/sda 1

Resize Filesystem: After resizing the partition, you need to resize the filesystem (example for ext4 filesystem on /dev/sda1):

# sudo resize2fs /dev/sda1
