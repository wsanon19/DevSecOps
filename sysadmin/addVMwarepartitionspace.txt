######################## Step 1: Increase the Disk Size in VMware
Shut down the virtual machine (recommended, although you might be able to do this online if your system allows).
Go to the VMware interface (vSphere, Workstation, or Fusion).
Open the Settings or Edit Settings for the VM.
Find the Hard Disk section for sda.
Increase the disk size to your desired size.
Save the settings and restart the VM.


########################Step 2: Rescan the Disk in the VM
After increasing the virtual disk size, boot up the VM and rescan the disk to detect the new size.
In the VM, run:
echo 1 | sudo tee /sys/class/block/sda/device/rescan


########################Step 3: Extend the Partition (sda3) with parted
Launch parted:
sudo parted /dev/sda
Resize the Partition:
Inside parted, set the unit to sectors to keep alignment:
(parted) unit s
Print the Partition Table to find the start sector of sda3:
(parted) print
Note the starting sector of sda3 (it should match the existing sda3 start).
Resize sda3 to the maximum available space:
(parted) resizepart 3 100%
Here, 3 is the partition number for sda3, and 100% tells parted to extend the partition to the end of the disk.
Exit parted:
(parted) quit


########################Step 4: Resize the Physical Volume (PV)
Resize the LVM Physical Volume to recognize the new space available in sda3:
sudo pvresize /dev/sda3


########################Step 5: Extend the Logical Volume (LV)
Extend the Logical Volume thatâ€™s mounted on /:

Use lsblk or lvdisplay to find the exact path of your Logical Volume (e.g., /dev/ubuntu--xxx/root).

Extend the LV to use all the free space in the Volume Group:
sudo lvextend -l +100%FREE /dev/ubuntu--xxx/root


######################## Step 6: Resize the Filesystem
Finally, resize the filesystem on the Logical Volume to use the extended space. Use the appropriate command for your filesystem type:

For ext4:
sudo resize2fs /dev/ubuntu--xxx/root
For XFS:

sudo xfs_growfs /


######################## Step 7: Verify the New Space
Check that the root filesystem has the additional space:

df -h /
This command should show the increased available space on your root filesystem.
